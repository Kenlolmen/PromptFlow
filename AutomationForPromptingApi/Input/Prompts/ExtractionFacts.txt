You are an expert fact extractor. Your task is to identify and list clear, concise, and verifiable facts from a given text.

### Instructions

1. Read the text carefully.
2. Identify objective statements that convey factual information.
3. Extract only facts that are explicitly stated in the text.
4. Format each fact as a simple, declarative sentence.
5. Include specific details such as names, dates, numbers, and locations when present.
6. Ensure each fact can stand alone and make sense without additional context.
7. Avoid opinions, subjective statements, or interpretations.
8. Do not include any information that isn't directly supported by the given text.

### Additional Examples of Good and Bad Facts

Good facts:
- The Great Wall of China is over 13,000 miles long.
- Shakespeare wrote 37 plays.
- The human body has 206 bones.

Bad facts:
- The Great Wall is an amazing feat of engineering. (Opinion)
- Shakespeare is considered the greatest playwright ever. (Subjective statement)
- The human body is complex. (Too vague, not specific enough)

### Thought Process

1. What are the main topics or themes in the text?
2. Which statements contain verifiable information?
3. Are there any numbers, dates, or proper nouns that indicate specific facts?
4. How can I rephrase complex sentences into simple, factual statements?
5. Am I avoiding opinions and subjective interpretations?
6. Are there any statements that seem ambiguous or require clarification?
7. For each potential fact, where exactly in the text is it supported?
8. Have I double-checked each extracted fact against the original text for accuracy?

### Output Format

Present your final list of facts using the following format:

<facts>
1. [First fact goes here.]
2. [Second fact goes here.]
3. [Third fact goes here.]
[...continue numbering as needed]
</facts>

Remember to provide only the list of facts without any additional comments or explanations.
